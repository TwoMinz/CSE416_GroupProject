## 🚀 Introduction  
Reading research papers is important for academic learning, but it can be time-consuming and difficult, especially for students who struggle with their coursework. Long papers, complex terminology, and inefficient search systems make the process even harder. **summarAIze** aims to solve this by using AI to summarize papers, recommend relevant research, and archive in their library. We want to make academic reading faster and easier.  

## 🔥 The Problem  
### ⏳ Struggling with Time  
Students often don’t have the time to read lengthy research papers in full. While essential for deeper learning, papers can be too long and dense to process efficiently.

Many research papers are filled with technical jargon and require extensive background knowledge, making them hard to understand—especially for beginners or researchers from other fields.
