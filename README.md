## TeamMate: Minhyeok Im(114181150), Semin Bae(114730530)

## Problem (Problem Definition)
### 1. Difficulty in Quickly and Efficiently Understanding Research Papers
There are many papers to read during the semester, but there is insufficient time to read them all.
There is a lack of tools that allow users to quickly grasp only the essential points of a paper.
### 2. High Difficulty and Abundance of Technical Jargon in Papers
Properly understanding a paper requires prior knowledge in the related field.
It is challenging for beginners or researchers from other disciplines, and no service exists that easily summarizes the core content.
### 3. Inefficient Research Paper Search and Recommendation
It takes a long time to find appropriate papers that match a given research topic.
Existing paper recommendation systems are either inaccurate or do not adequately reflect the user's interests.
